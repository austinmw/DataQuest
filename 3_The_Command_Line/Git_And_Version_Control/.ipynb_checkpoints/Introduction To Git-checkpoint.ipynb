    "When you're working with teams, you'll generally be making changes to the same files. Imagine you're working on a project to make a Python script, and have a folder with the following two files:\n",

    "    README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the contents of script.py:\n",

    "    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "        print(\"Welcome to a script!\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Imagine that you and a coworker are both working on the project at the same time. You modify script.py like this:\n",

    "Imagine you both have the folder on your local machine. To modify files, you make changes, then upload the entire folder to a centralized location, like Dropbox or Google Drive, to enable collaboration. If you didn't have a distributed version control system, whoever changed the file last will overwrite the changes of the other person. This gets extremely frustrating and impossible to manage as you start dealing with larger and larger chunks of code. What if the folder had 100 files, and you modified 10, and your coworker modified 30 at the same time? You don't want to lose your changes every time your coworker uploads his version of the folder. Now, imagine that instead of just you and a coworker, it's a project with 10 or 100 contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies face this problem every day, which is why distributed version control systems exist. With a distributed version control system, software will \"merge\" changes together intelligently, and enable multiple developers to work on a project at the same time.\n",
