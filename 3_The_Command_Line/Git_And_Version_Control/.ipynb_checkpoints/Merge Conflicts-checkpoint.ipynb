    "When we merge a branch into another one, our changes can sometimes conflict with other people's commits. Let's say that you're working on a project with another developer named Ninja Jane. You both edit the same file on your own branches, then Jane pushes her branch to the remote and merges it into master:\n",
    "\n",
    "This chain of events results in the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the commit history for each branch looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you and Jane branched off of master at the same time and you both made one commit, the histories for the two branches are almost identical. However, the latest commit for master and shuriken is 45g, and the latest commit for superbot is 782.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to merge superbot into master, Git will notice that 45g and 782 both come immediately after 67f, and both edit the same lines in the same files. Because both commits are based on 67f, they're equally valid, and this causes a merge conflict. Git can't overwrite the changes in master with the changes from superbot because it doesn't know which changes are the \"correct\" ones. Git is designed to preserve everyone's work, so it won't cause a loss of effort by intentionally overwriting one person's commit with another's.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not possible for Git to just layer the commits on top of each other, because 782 and 45g both come immediately after commit 67f. If Git layered the changes on top of each other and applied commit 782 from superbot, Jane's changes in commit 45g would be overwritten and lost. If commit782insuperbotcame after commit45g` in the Git history instead, there would be no conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Git can't merge commits automatically, it informs the user of a merge conflict and asks them to sort it out. Sorting out a merge conflict involves editing the code that conflicts to create the \"correct\" version. This way, the person who wrote the code is in charge of resolving the issue, and Git isn't intentionally overwriting anyone's changes."
