    "## 1: Git Remotes\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful ways to use git is to use it in conjunction with Github. Using git with Github allows you to push your code to remote repositories. This enables you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Share your code with others and build a portfolio.\n",
    "- Collaborate with others on your project and build your code together.\n",
    "- Download and use code others have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here's](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/evolve-music2) an example of a remote repository on Github. Repositories can be viewed on your Github profile, and are a great way to build a portfolio and get noticed by recruiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote repositories aren't just useful for building a portfolio. Pushing to Github also allows you to collaborate with others on your code. For example, linux is developed on Github, and has thousands of different contributors. Many companies, including Google and Facebook, also use Github to work on code projects across teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote repositories also enable you to access and use code you didn't write. For instance, [this repo](https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne) will let you download Amazon's Deep Learning tools and start training models. Since the reposistory is public, it's accessible by anyone, and can be downloaded and used by anyone. Repositories on Github can also be private, in which case they are hidden, and not accessible by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a remote repository onto your own computer, you'll need to do something called cloning. cloning copies a repository from one location to a folder on your computer. The repository retains all of its git history, and you can work with it just like you would work with a git repository you created yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to clone a remote repository, we'll use the git clone command. If we were cloning from Github, we'd specify a Github URL to clone a repository from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we'd clone the Amazon Deep Learning repo from Github:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne.git\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne.git is the URL of the git repository that we're cloning. This will automatically create a folder called amazon-dsstne in our current folder, and place the repository there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're working with a simplified remote repository for the purposes of this mission, we'll clone a repository slightly differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone /dataquest/user/git/chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "This will clone the repository from /dataquest/user/git/chatbot, a path on our local computer, to our current folder, and place it into a folder called chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we specify a second argument to git clone, we can change the folder the repository is saved to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone /dataquest/user/git/chatbot silentbot\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code will place the chatbot repository into a folder called silentbot."

    "\n",
    "Now that we've cloned a repository (or repo for short), we can makes changes in the same way that we did in the last mission. We'll be able to edit files, add them to the staging area, and then commit the changes. These changes will be reflected in the local version of the repo, but not the remote version.\n",

    "The README.md file is one you'll often see in projects on Github. A README file helps people understand what the project is about and how to install it. It's common for the README file to be in Markdown format, which is a way to create lists and other complex but useful structures using plain text. The markdown format has the .md extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the diagram above, we'll edit the README.md file to add a line, then commit it to the repository. When updating shared repositories, it's important to add informative messages when comitting, so other people can easily figure out what each commit is doing without reading through the code. This gets really important when debugging issues with code that multiple people are working on."

    "Now that we know about commit hashes, we can use them to switch to a specific commit. Switching between commits allows us to quickly move between different historical versions of a project. If we introduce a change that causes issues and want to revert to an earlier version, for example, switching between commits will let us do so.\n",

    "Commit hashes are permanent; Git preserves them and includes them in transfers between the local repo and the remote repo. For instance, let's say we have two commits, c12 and c53. The following diagram shows what happens to them as we clone, commit, and push.\n",
    "\n",

    "When we changed a file and made a commit locally, Git gave it the hash c53. When we pushed this commit to the remote later on, it kept the same hash because it was still the same commit. In the diagram above, both the local repo and the remote repo have two commits, c12 and c53. We can switch between commits in the local repo without changing what commits are in the remote repo. We can do this with the git reset command:\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram shows the commit on the left, and a representation of our working directory on the right. If we type git reset --hard c12, Git switches back to the commit with the hash c12, and changes all of the files in the working directory so that they're exactly the same as the files in the commit. This will essentially let us rewind the repo to past commits if there are problems with more recent ones, or if we want to see what the project looked like at an earlier point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The --hard flag resets both the working directory and the Git history to a specific state. If we omitted the flag, or used the --soft flag instead, it would skip making changes to the working directory, and only reset the Git history."
