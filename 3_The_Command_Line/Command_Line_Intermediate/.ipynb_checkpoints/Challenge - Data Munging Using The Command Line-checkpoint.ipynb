    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll practice the command line concepts you've learned so far by munging datasets using just the command line. Data munging involves transforming datasets to make them easier to work with. Some datasets are too large to load into Python, so looking at them or transforming them beforehand can be useful. Even for smaller datasets, simple exploration on the command line is faster than exploration in Python, and file-based tasks like unifying datasets can be faster on the command line.\n",
