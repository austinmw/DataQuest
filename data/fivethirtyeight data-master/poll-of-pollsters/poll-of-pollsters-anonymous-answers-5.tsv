About the same	Results seem to be rather constant overall with the past in terms of results.	No	A decline in response rates does not necessarily result in one candidate or political party losing ground more than another.	About the same					Declined	Many more media articles calling into question the accuracy of polls this year	I thought her article mashed together a lot of concepts only vaguely related to one another. I thought the specifics of her critiques were wildly off the mark.	Florida	North Carolina	Texas			FL, NC, and TX are large, diverse states with varied candidate affiliations.	Hurt	"The coverage hurts it because it is treating the news of a new poll as some kind of equivalent piece of news, and comparing polling with completely different methods and sources as a trend, when really, you're talking about small samples, so movements of a couple of people from one sample to the next makes for a very messy ""trendline."""	No	The response is not to ignore them, but to understand what they are and are not telling us.	No	See above answer. The leaders of a polling average in Iowa and New Hampshire (if different; if it's the same, then whoever is the closer second in the states) draft opponents one-by-one until everyone is selected and there are then two debates.	No	Pollsters have no real idea about what the electorate will look like, plus, the people who will actually decide the election won't decide until much later.	No	Definitely not in the media, but for our clients, it can be beneficial because it can allow them to figure out which and how to talk about issues. But mostly it's a no.	Live-interviewer polls		No		Not sure	You'd have to do two versions of a poll to test it.	Helps		No		"Depends on what you are trying to capture. It's very tricky. We used to just offer ""Catholic,"" and felt we were undercounting. So, we experimented with ""Roman Catholic,"" and the percentage claiming that as the religion they identify with increased to what we expected. Odd, but true."	Bad	I think it's disappointing that Gallup spent a ton of resources on best practices and then gave up on a key metric. Just because it's hard doesn't mean you should stop doing it. They are a leader in the industry and I would have preferred they keep trying to perfect it like the rest of us!	No		No	Not yet. 	No		Badly		No		Hillary Clinton		Chris Christie		49	220	A question for media pollsters (i.e. those working at news organizations): I'm interested in the shift towards the online methodologies they -- until very recently -- decried. What caused this shift internally?
About the same		No	I guess I've gotten used to the idea.	About the same	Little change here in New Jersey, which is where we conduct the majority of our polls.	8	8	Percent of contacts who complete an interview	Declined	"People on the right see stories about polling from PPP (or others) that the media treats as ""Look at these crazy people who believe these untrue things"", and people on the left see polling that shows people believe untrue things because the media keeps lying to them. Plus, the pollsters have not learned lessons from mistakes in the past."	"If you are going to govern based on polling, then yes, because the American public is full of people who only learn about information from biased news sources, whether it be from a partisan source like Fox News, or an ""If it bleeds, it leads"" source like local news."	Iowa	New Hampshire	Nevada	Maryland		Caucuses because they're hard to figure out who is going to go there, and New Hampshire because, even though they like to imagine they are independent people, they shift due to results in Iowa and in the last couple of days. And Maryland because they like to act smart.	Not sure	I think the answer is neither -- polling during presidential primaries just serve as a regular reminder that polls are a snapshot in time and polls taken far in advance of an election are not predictive. Presidential primaries are just a giant reminder of that because they are so volatile.	No	They provide an insight into what the American electorate is thinking. If properly qualified, and compared to previous pre-election polls, they can be useful.	No	The nomination battle is not truly national, so I think there is a mismatch there. I also have some real hesitation in using polls to determine who should be on the debate stage to begin with. Perhaps instead of the media hosts for the debates determining the criteria (e.g., CNN), the parties themselves should do so independently. Such an approach would hew more closely to the fact that these nomination contests are a party affair to begin with--the party is choosing its nominee so perhaps the party should establish its criteria for inclusion.	No				Live-interviewer polls	Although I think there is some bias against saying they support Trump amongst his weaker supporters when asked by a live-interviewer, he is also not actually running a campaign, and so I think his numbers are lower than the IVR polls suggest.	No	Maybe news polls, but campaign polling doesn't.	Yes		Helps	Because he doesn't actually care about whether what he says is popular, as much as whether the media will cover him to the exclusion of candidates who don't say racist things. Also, people don't trust pollsters, and like politicians who claim to not be going with what pollsters tell them to say.	No	Too difficult to find a remotely scientific sample. Plus, no one responsible would pay us for that.	"Depends on what you're using them for. The ""Catholic"" vote has, in the past, been a pretty decent proxy for the range of opinions and habits in the electorate."	Bad		No		No		No	Not necessarily is the real answer. Tracking convention wisdom works until it doesn't.	Badly	My observation this cycle is all polls are pretty much treated as equal.	No		Hillary Clinton		Marco Rubio		49	230	I'll think on it and email, Carl.
About the same	It's an uncertain time for the industry, no question about it. But the uncertainty hasn't gone up or down in the last year. Ask me again in a year after we've seen how the polls have done in the 2016 election cycle.	No	The research has long shown that the political orientations of the people we miss are not very different from the people who respond. At some point that may change. Moreover, polls that use voter files can be very clear about who is not responding and take ameliorative action.	About the same		9	9	Percentage of those called with whom we are able to achieve a completed interview.	Declined	It seems not a week goes by without a handwringing piece about the state of polling, and with that comes the growing popular sense that pollsters and their polls are not as reliable, valid, or valuable as they once were.	Like much of her article, I didn't understand the point.	Iowa					I assume the question is focused on just presidential nomination elections. Given the low participation rate for the precinct caucus generally (due to all sorts of reasons including the time commitment all in one evening, the fact that it is a unique type of nomination election with special rules and procedures, etc.), it makes polling that event very difficult.	Not sure		No		No	It's a hard call, but the stage has to be limited somehow, if viewers are going to get anything out of the debates. But I would combine early state showing and the national data in some way.	Not sure	I assume you are asking about hypothetical matchup polling (e.g., Trump v. Clinton). There may be some limited value in consideration of specific candidate matchups, but the value is very limited. I think hypothetical matchups tend to say more about the respondent's gut reaction to the candidates now (and perhaps to some inchoate sense of how things are going now), rather than some appreciation for what the future would look like. Once the campaigning, media attention, events, etc. start unfolding in the real matchup, then things change. I think media reporting on such polling seems to assume that the respondents are predicting the future.	Yes		Live-interviewer polls	This question of live-interviewer v. IVR and other methods is one of the more fascinating storylines of this polling season. Right now, I still go with the live-interviewer as the one to follow.	No	There is no doubt that his fate will have repercussions for polling. Looking at the live-interviewer v. IVR, etc. methods is part of that. But, he is something of a unique political force, so the lessons for polling related to Trump might not be generalizable too far. So, with the IVR question--if those polls end up being more accurate on Trump in the final days before the primaries, then this doesn't necessarily mean that IVR and other methods are how polling must be conducted. Such a result could simply mean that the social desirability bias was at play with Trump (and as such with future candidates like him). That result doesn't strike me as shaping polling's central nature or approach.	Yes	You should not ask questions about issues before horse-race questions. You can ask most important issue, but if you are asking how they feel about specific issues or policies, your horse-race question is useless, if not actively harmful.	Helps		No		I think you have to start digging a bit into categories within religious groups. White Catholics are very different from Hispanics, for example. Pew has effective research on this.	Bad	Displays a lack of confidence in their own product.	No		Not sure	Jury's out, but they've sure hired a bunch of really smart people so I'll be watching closely.	No		Not sure		Yes	Decline to state	Hillary Clinton		Marco Rubio		49	230	It would be good to ask some methodological questions about modes, mixed modes, and likely voter/probable electorate definitions.
About the same		No	Pew Research on non-response settled this for a while. Of course, we always worry about the future.	About the same	Nothing has really changed here since 2014.				Declined		No response.	Iowa	Nevada	everything that follows Iowa and New Hampshire			Iowa--hard & costly to know who will show up. Nevada--caucus and hard state to poll. What happens in Iowa and New Hampshire affects what happens everywhere else.	Not sure		Yes	Because they're bullshit polls of non-existent primaries. Just like national general election polls.	No	"It's not the role of pollsters to set the terms of debates. If the field is too large, a fairer way would be to divide the field in half by lottery and have two debates (not one ""main stage"" and one ""undercard"")."	Not sure				Live-interviewer polls	If I had to bet on one, it would be the one with history. There is no history of online state level polling in presidential primaries. It's really hard to know what to make of the size of the gap.	No	The nature of polling in the future depends on which kinds of polls do the best job at representing the outcome. But it could be they converge before voting happens. So I don't think it's quite that black-and-white.	Yes		Helps		No		On their own, they can be very misleading. One way we approach mitigating that is by asking frequency of church attendance, etc.	Good	People kept believing their polling was more accurate than other polling, when it was full of the same, if not more, biases as other polling.	No		Not sure	We are taking a wait-and-see attitude about this.	Not sure	No comment	Not sure	Again, it depends on the site. Some are better than others.	Yes	Gravis Marketing (they still exist, right?).	Hillary Clinton		Marco Rubio		51	233	More information about how the Internet surveys are being conducted.
About the same	Well, there are new polling operations, some of which are inexperienced and not very good. But the firms that have been doing this a while seem to be performing about the same.	No	Response rates and poll accuracy are not necessarily related.	About the same		10	10	Of people we call, how many are completing an interview 	Declined	The public generally does not understand what we do and how we do it. Misses by pollsters are highly publicized and thus the image of the industry in general suffers.	The concern Lindsay had that representatives would simply vote based upon what the majority articulated via polls without concern for the needs/rights of the minority strikes me more as a failure of political leadership and a misuse of public opinion than an indictment of polling itself.	the	ones	with	cau	cuses	The toughest primary is still easier to poll than the easiest caucus.	Not sure		Yes		No		Yes	"""Any attention"" is a low threshold."			Live-interviewer polls		No		Yes	Focusing on specific issues is key to winning a campaign. Trump wins among Republican primary voters focused on immigration.	Helps	It helps boost his contention that he's not a conventional candidate, driven by polls and consultants and donors. Whether that's a winning strategy, who knows (now)?	No	Very difficult to get a random sample of of all American Muslims. Maybe you could do a community--Dearborn, Michigan, for example. But would that reflect Muslims in New York?	Some are, some aren't ...we focus more on attendance at religious services.	Good	It adds an important marker to the debate about the deep review of sources and methods in the political polling business.	No		Not sure		Not sure		OK	"There are more ""bad"" polling organizations now, so it becomes harder to use the better ones."	Yes	Any poll that does not call cell phones should certainly be eliminated.	Hillary Clinton		Marco Rubio		51	235	Their sample methodology. Random-digit dialing or list based? How do you draw your sample for a primary survey? What is your threshold for a randomized telephone sample to achieve acceptable coverage of the voting population you are trying to survey?
About the same		No	I don't trust most media polling, so I'm basically skeptical of the accuracy of polling averages in the first place. Also, anyone who expected the 2014 or 2015 results to be as pro-Democratic as the polling didn't learn their lesson from 2010.	About the same		9	9	AAPOR2	Declined								This is a tough question -- how do you define hard? Costly? Low response rate? Tough to predict the electorate? Tough to predict the outcome?	Not sure										Neither	The key is, find those who will show up. Few of these polls do a good job of that.	No	Why would it? If he wins the election, the early polls will have shown that he somehow captured the imagination, and, later, the votes, of the public. If he loses, so what? Many early front-runners lose.	Yes	Guess. Totally open to data.	Neither		Not sure	Have not been approached with this.	Somewhat.	Good		No		Not sure	We'll see over time.	Not sure	Controversy in the literature about this...and honestly I don't care.	OK				Hillary Clinton		Marco Rubio		52	235	Which do you think is more important far out in advance of a general election: horse-race, personal popularity, or personal characteristics and impressions of candidates? Are you concerned about missing people who are not on a listed sample, compared to random-digit dialing?
Better	There is a continuing and highly substantive debate underway about survey methodology, lessons learned, multi-mode polls, etc. It's all to the good and I'm confident it will lead to better and more reliable polling.	Not sure	If you take your time and execute good methodology you can be accurate. Polling is costly and time consuming and most institutions or clients are neither willing to pay the money to do it correctly or patient enough to do it correctly.	About the same		12.13		# fully complete responses / # successfully contacted	Neither	I think we are on a high wire at the moment. It's no secret that online and telephone polls are producing wildly different estimates right now. This poses a threat to credibility, given the many eggs in the online polling basket, and the problems facing telephone polling.								Not sure										Neither	How is one to know?	No		Yes		Neither		Not sure	Tough group to find a large enough sample of.		Neither	It does not affect my business or clients in any way.	No		Not sure	Ask me in 11 months.	Not sure		Well				Hillary Clinton		Other (please specify)	Don't know	52	236	
Not sure	The reality is that it is hard to measure polling in america because media polls are mostly shit and I don't know quite how to judge my colleagues in the political polling world. We take great care in our methodology, call back procedures, time in the field, etc. And we still have a lot of success in accuracy. But I think there are a lot of shops that cut corners.	Not sure		About the same	We're not seeing a decline in incidence, or response rates.				Neither																											Not sure			Neither	It would be nice if they stayed in just to avoid the story. But they didn't have a very good cycle in 2012, and contributed to the narrative of polls being all over the place.	Yes	Strategic Vision	Not sure	I do not know enough about how SurveyMonley is sampling to recruit its panel. They have hired two well-respected polling experts, so I have to pay attention to what they are doing.	Not sure	We have no idea if the way any poll or prediction market is accurate BEFORE we know the outcome. In the past they have been reasonably accurate. But as they say, past performance is no guarantee of future returns.	Well	I think. Some clunkers might slip through.			Hillary Clinton		Other (please specify)	I don't make predictions. 	Don't know	Don't know	
Not sure		Not sure	Terribly worded question: assumes that response rates correlate with accuracy, which they do not.	Harder	The only change we've observed is that we now need to dial more cell phones to ensure our polls continue to reflect the voter population.																															Yes			Neither	Gallup made a business decision. Their polling unit, as I understand, is a loss leader. It is still considered a valuable part of their business, so I think they wanted to stop doing things that put their brand at risk.		I don't think we said that and I have no opinion on what you and others might have done.	Yes	It's not like they're that much worse than doing an IVR poll, and SurveyMonkey is no Zogby.	Yes	Prediction markets use news sources as well as polling to estimate who is leading. So basically, it has more information, which is better than less information.	Well				Hillary Clinton		Other (please specify)	No idea	Don't know	Don't know	
Worse	"I think it's worse in the eyes of the public, as perceptions of pollsters have taken a hit given the misfires in recent elections. That's what makes news. Accuracy rarely does not. However, having just volunteered time to help organize the AAPOR conference, and being privy to the hundreds of papers proposed, I'm impressed with the commitment to methodological innovation that's present in our industry. So, even thought I responded ""worse,"" I can't say the same for the integrity and commitment of researchers/pollsters in the profession."	Yes	The use of weighting techniques by some may explain why polls haven't been further off, but it is still somewhat surprising that things haven't gotten even worse in terms of missing results.	Harder	More people are cell-phone only.	40	35	Net effective incidence rate																																											Hillary Clinton		Ted Cruz		I don't make predictions. 	I don't make predictions. 	
Worse	As more and more people in this country shift to cell phone only households, it becomes harder to do rigorous scientific phone polling for reasonable prices, and the main IVR polling firms still have questionable methods.	Yes		Harder	The likely voting population the 2014 cycle was much older than the likely voting population of 2016. With larger participation rates of younger and minority voters, it will be harder to maintain similar response rates in 2016 compared to 2014.	8	10	The percentage of respondents who completed the full survey divided by the number of households called.																																											Hillary Clinton		Ted Cruz				
Worse		Yes	It's hard enough to measure likely voters. When you add to this the difficulty of response rates that have gone south, any reasonable person would continue to find accuracy both surprising and a testament to the quality of well-done election polls.
