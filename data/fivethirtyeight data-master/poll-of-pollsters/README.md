Respondents include commercial and academic pollsters who identify their polling organizations as liberal, nonpartisan or conservative. Some poll online, some by phone, some both. Some answers have been edited, primarily for spelling, grammar, style and to protect anonymity, when requested.

The responses are broken up into two files for each poll.

The first file has a name like `poll-of-pollsters.tsv`:

This tab-separated file contains the names of the respondents, their polling organizations, and those responses that they have agreed can be attributed to them. The heading of each column contains a question, and below it, in each row the answer given by the pollster listed in that row. Empty fields either mean the pollster didn't answer that question, or didn't wish to have the answer attributed.

The second file has a name like `poll-of-pollsters-anonymous-answers.tsv`:

This tab-separated file contains those responses that pollsters didn't want attributed to them. The heading of each column contains a question, and below it, the responses to that question, in alphabetical order. That means that each row doesn’t correspond to any one respondent. For example, the answer in the fourth row, in the third column, wasn't necessarily given by the same respondent as the rest of the answers in the fourth row. This sorting step was taken to better protect anonymity, by making it harder to figure out who gave which answer.
