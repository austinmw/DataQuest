    "## 1: Introduction To Systems Of Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we have two ships. We know the total value of the cargo in each ship's hold, but we don't know how much each item costs. There are two different kinds of items—fusion reactors, and giant robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent fusion reactors with the variable $x$, and giant robots with the variable $y$. The first ship has two fusion reactors and one giant robot, and the cargo is worth \\$25 billion. The second ship has three fusion reactors and two giant robots, and the cargo is worth \\$40 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this mathematically as a system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2x + y \\ = 25$$\n",
    "$$3x+2y= 40$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We've just rewritten the information we had from before. Two fusion reactors plus one giant robot equals \\$25 billion, and three fusion reactors plus two giant robots equals \\$40 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can begin to solve this system by multiplying the top equation by 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$4x + 2y = 50$$\n",
    "$$3x + 2y = 40$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because if $2x+y=25$, then it makes sense that $4x+2y=50$; we're just doubling everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to subtract the bottom equation from the top equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x = 10$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that $x$ is $10$, which means that a fusion reactor is worth $10 billion. Because both equations are true statements, subtracting one from the other also yields a true statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know that $x$ equals 10, we can substitute that value into the bottom equation to solve for $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3*10+10y=40$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which simplifies to: $$2y=10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally: $$y=5$$\n",

    "## 2: Systems Of Equations As Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "We've worked a bit with matrices before, and the very cool thing about systems of equations is that we can represent them the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could represent our equations above as a matrix that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/pic1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "This is just a matrix that contains the coefficients and constants in our equations. We call this an augmented matrix, because it has both the constants and the coefficients. The line separates them, with constants to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix has three columns and two rows (where each row represents an equation in the system). The first column represents $x$\n",
    ", the second represents $y$\n",
    ", and the third is for the constants in the equations (which appear on the right of the = sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems of equations form the underpinnings of linear algebra, but we generally work with matrices like this one because it's easier for us to represent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to represent a matrix in Python is with a NumPy array. A NumPy array can have rows and columns, just like a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "1. Multiply the first row of the matrix by 2.\n",
    "2. Subtract the second row from the first row.\n",
    "3. Subtract 3 times the first row from the second row.\n",
    "4. Finally, divide the second row by 2 to get rid of the coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're finished, the first row should indicate that $x$\n",
    " equals $10$\n",
    ", and the second row should indicate that $y$\n",
    " equals $5$\n",
    ". We just solved our equation with matrices!"

This scenario usually occurs when we're unable to simplify an equation down to the point where each variable is alone in a row.
