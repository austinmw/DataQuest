    "\n",
    "In the last screen, our calculated chi-squared value is greater than all the values in the distribution, so our p-value is 0, indicating that our result is statistically significant. You may recall from the last mission that .05 is the typical threshold for statistical significance, and anything below it is considered significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant value indicates that something is different between the observed and expected values, but it doesn't indicate what is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a chi-squared sampling distribution, we can compare the chi-squared value we calculated for our data to it to see if our result is statistically significant. The chi-squared value we calculated was 3728.95. The highest value in the chi-squared sampling distribution was about 12. This means that our chi-squared value is higher than 100% of all the values in the sampling distribution, so we get a p-value of 0. This means that there is a 0% chance that we could get such a result randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would indicate that we need to investigate our data collection techniques more closely to figure out why such a result occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a chi-squared value has no sign (all chi-squared values are positive), it doesn't tell us anything about the direction of the statistical significance. If we had 10771 Females, and 21790 Males, or 10771 Males, and 21790 Females, we'd get the same chi-squared value. It's important to look at the data and see how the data is unbalanced after calculating a chi-squared value and getting a significant result."
