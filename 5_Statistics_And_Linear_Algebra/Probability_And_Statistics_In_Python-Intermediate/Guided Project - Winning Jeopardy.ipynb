    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture. If you need help at any point, you can consult our solution notebook [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission210Solution.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, you'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file). Here's the beginning of the file:\n",

    "- Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "- Air Date -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "- Category -- the category of the question.\n",
    "- Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "- Question -- the text of the question.\n",
    "- Answer -- the text of the answer.\n",

    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "- Read the dataset into a Dataframe called jeopardy using Pandas.\n",
    "- Print out the first 5 rows of jeopardy.\n",
    "- Print out the columns of jeopardy using jeopardy.columns.\n",
    "- Some of the column names have spaces in front.\n",
    "    - Remove the spaces in each item in jeopardy.columns.\n",
    "    - Assign the result back to jeopardy.columns to fix the column names in jeopardy.\n",

    "    - Divide total by the number of rows in jeopardy to get the proportion across the dataset. Assign to total_prop.\n",
    "    - Multiply total_prop by high_value_count to get the expected term count for high value rows.\n",
    "    - Multiply total_prop by low_value_count to get the expected term count for low value rows.\n",
    "    - Use the scipy.stats.chisquare function to compute the chi-squared value and p-value given the expected and observed counts.\n",
