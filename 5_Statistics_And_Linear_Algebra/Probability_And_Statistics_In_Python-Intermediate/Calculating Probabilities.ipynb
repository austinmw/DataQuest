    "## 13: Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we've invented a weather control device that can make the weather sunny (if only!), and we decide to test it on Los Angeles. The device isn't perfect, and can't make every single day sunny -- it can only increase the chance that a day is sunny. We turn it on for 10 days, and notice that the weather is sunny in 8 of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "We touched on the question of statistical significance before -- it's the question of whether a result happened as the result of something we changed, or whether a result is a matter of random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typically, researchers will use 5% as a significance threshold** -- if an event would only happen 5% or less of the time by random chance, then it is statistically significant. If an event would happen more than 5% of the time by random chance, then it isn't statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine statistical significance, we need to determine the percentage chance that the number of outcomes we saw or greater could happen by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, there is 12% chance that the weather would be sunny 8 days out of 10 by random chance. We add this to 4% for 9 days out of 10, and .6% for 10 days out of 10 to get a 16.6% total chance of the sunny outcome happening 8 or more time in our 10 days. Our result isn't statistically significant, so we'd have to go back to the lab and spend some time adding more flux capacitors to our weather control device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we recalibrate our weather control device successfully, and observe for 10 more days, of which 9 of them are sunny. This only has a 4.6% chance of happening randomly (probability of 9 plus probability of 10). This is a statistically significant result, but it isn't a slam-dunk. It would require more investigation, including collecting results for more days, to get a more conclusive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, setting statistical significance thresholds is tricky, and can be highly variable. We'll be touching on how to set thresholds later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note: for a normal distribution, 5% of the data is 2 standard deviations from the mean**"
