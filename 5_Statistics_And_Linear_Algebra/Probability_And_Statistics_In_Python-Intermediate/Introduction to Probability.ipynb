    "We covered a bit of probability in the last mission, but we'll go more into depth here and build a strong foundation. Before we do that, let's introduce our dataset. Our dataset contains information on flags of countries around the world. Each row is a country. Here are the relevant columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- name -- name of the country\n",
    "- landmass -- which continent the country is in (1=N.America, 2=S.America, 3=Europe, 4=Africa, 4=Asia, 6=Oceania)\n",
    "- area -- country area, in thousands of square kilometers\n",
    "- population -- rounded to the nearest million\n",
    "- bars -- Number of vertical bars in the flag\n",
    "- stripes -- Number of horizontal stripes in the flag\n",
    "- colors -- Number of different colours in the flag\n",
    "- red, green, blue, gold, white, black, orange -- 0 if color absent, 1 if color present in the flag\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was collected from Collins Gem Guide to Flags. It was written in 1986, so some flag information may be out of date!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "- Find the country with the most bars in its flag. Assign the name of the country to most_bars_country.\n",

    "## 7: Disjunctive Probabilities With Multiple Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "We've looked at disjunctive probabilities in cases where there are only two conditions (A or B). But what if we have three or more conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have 10 cars again. 5 are red and 5 are blue. 5 are convertibles and 5 are sport utility vehicles. 5 have a top speed of 130mph, and 5 have a top speed of 110mph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to find all cars that are red or convertibles or have a top speed of 130mph. Let's say 2 cars meet all three criteria. We would end up with 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/5, or a 1.3 probability if we tried to apply the formula from before. This is clearly false, as we can't have a probability greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to solve for cases like this is to find everything that doesn't match our criteria first. In this case, we'd look for blue sport utility vehicles with a top speed of 110mph. We would then subtract that probability from 1 to get the probability of red or convertible or 130mph top speed. Let's say there are 2 vehicles that are blue and sport utility vehicles and have a 110mph top speed. We would get a 1 - .2 or .8 probability for red or convertible or 130mph top speed.\n",

    "- Let's say we have a coin that we're flipping. Find the probability that at least one of the first three flips comes up heads. Assign the result to heads_or."
