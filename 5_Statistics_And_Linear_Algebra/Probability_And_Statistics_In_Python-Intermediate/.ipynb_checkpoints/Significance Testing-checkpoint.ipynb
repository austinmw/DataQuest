    "## 1: Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll learn about hypothesis testing and statistical significance. A hypothesis is a pattern or rule about a process in the world that can be tested. We use hypothesis testing to determine if a change we made had a meaningful impact or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use hypothesis testing to help you determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if a new banner ad on a website caused a meaningful drop in the user engagement,\n",
    "- if raising the price of a product caused a meaningful drop in sales,\n",
    "- if a new weight loss pill helped people lose more weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing a decrease in user engagement or sales after instituting a change doesn't automatically imply that the change was the cause. Hypothesis testing allows us to calculate the probability that random chance was actually responsible for the difference in outcome. Every process has some inherent amount of randomness that we can't measure and understanding the role of chance helps us reach a conclusion that's more likely to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first set up a **null hypothesis** that describes the status quo. We then state an **alternative hypothesis**, which we used to compare with the null hypothesis to decide which describes the data better. In the end, we either need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis or\n",
    "accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "We can frame each of the studies above as these rival pairs of hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if a new banner ad on a website caused a meaningful drop in the user engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - null hypothesis: users who were exposed to the banner ad spent the same amount of time on the website than those who weren't.\n",
    "    - alternative hypothesis: users who were exposed to the banner ad spent less time on the website than those who weren't.\n",
    "\n",
    "- if raising the price of a product caused a meaningful drop in sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - null hypothesis: the number of purchases of the product was the same at the lower price than it was at the higher price.\n",
    "    - alternative hypothesis: the number of purchases of the product was lower at the higher price than it was at the lower price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- if a new weight loss pill helped people lose more weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - null hypothesis: patients who went on the weight loss pill lost no more weight than those who didn't.\n",
    "    - alternative hypothesis: patients who went on the weight loss pill lost more weight than those who didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this mission, we'll focus on the third scenario and use data to determine if a weight loss pill helped people lose weight."

    "## 2: Research Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us determine if the weight loss pill was effective, we conducted a study where we invited 100 volunteers and split them into 2 even groups randomly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group A was given a placebo, or fake, pill and instructed to consume it on a daily basis.\n",
    "- Group B was given the actual weight loss pill and instructed to consume it on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both groups were instructed to change nothing else about their diets. Group A is referred to as the control group while group B is referred to as the treatment group. This type of study is called a **blind experiment** since the participants didn't know which pill they were receiving. This helps us reduce the potential bias that is introduced when participants know which pill they were given. For example, participants who are aware they were given the weight loss pill may try to add healthier foods to their diet to help them lose more weight. Both groups were weighed before the study began and a month later, after the study ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the **research design** for a study is an important first step that informs the rest of your analysis. It helps us uncover potential flaws in the study that we need to keep in mind as we dive deeper. The weight loss pill study we conducted is known as an **experimental study**. Experimental studies usually involve bringing in participants, instructing them to perform some tasks, and observing them. A key part of running an experimental study is **random assignment**, which involves assigning participants in the study to random groups without revealing which group each participant is in. Before exploring and analyzing a dataset, it's important to understand how the study was conducted. Flaws in how the study was run can lead you to reach the wrong conclusions."

    "## 3: Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics helps us determine if the difference in the weight lost between the 2 groups is because of random chance or because of an actual difference in the outcomes. If there is a meaningful difference, we say that the results are **statistically significant**. We'll dive into what this means exactly over the course of this mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're familiar with the study, let's state our null and alternative hypotheses more precisely. Our null hypothesis should describe the default position of skepticism, which is that there's no statistically significant difference between the outcomes of the 2 groups. Put another way, it should state that any difference is due to random chance. Our alternative hypothesis should state that there is in fact a statistically significant difference between the outcomes of the 2 groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis: participants who consumed the weight loss pills lost the same amount of weight as those who didn't take the pill.\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis: participants who consumed the weight loss pills lost more weight than those who didn't take the pill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lists weight_lost_a and weight_lost_b contain the amount of weight (in pounds) that the participants in each group lost. Let's now explore the data to become more familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "- Use the NumPy function mean() to calculate:\n",
    "    - The mean of the weight lost by participants in group A. Assign to mean_group_a and display it using the print() function.\n",
    "    - The mean of the weight lost by participants in group B. Assign to mean_group_b and display it using the print() function.\n",
    "- Use the Matplotlib function hist() to plot histograms for both weight_lost_a and weight_lost_b."

    "To decide which hypothesis more accurately describes the data, we need to frame the hypotheses more quantitatively. The first step is to decide on a **test statistic**, which is a numerical value that summarizes the data and we can use in statistical formulas. We use this test statistic to run a statistical test that will determine how likely the difference between the groups were due to random chance.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Now that we have a test statistic, we need to decide on a statistical test**. The purpose of a statistical test is to work out the likelihood that the result we achieved was due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **permutation test** is a statistical test that involves simulating rerunning the study many times and recalculating the test statistic for each iteration. The goal is to calculate a distribution of the test statistics over these many iterations. This distribution is called the **sampling distribution** and it approximates the full range of possible test statistics under the null hypothesis. We can then benchmark the test statistic we observed in the data (a mean difference of 2.52) to determine how likely it is to observe this mean difference under the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, that the weight loss pill doesn't help people lose more weight, than the observed mean difference of 2.52 should be quite common in the sampling distribution. If it's instead extremely rare, then we accept the alternative hypothesis instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate rerunning the study, we randomly reassign each data point (weight lost) to either group A or group B. We keep track of the recalculated test statistics as a separate list. By re-randomizing the groups that the weight loss values belong to, we're simulating what randomly generated groupings of these weight loss values would look like. We then use these randomly generated groupings to understand how rare the groupings in our actual data were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the number of times we re-randomize the groups that each data point belongs to matches the total number of possible permutations. Usually, the number of total permutations is too high for even powerful supercomputers to calculate within a reasonable time frame. While we'll use 1000 iterations for now since we'll get the results back quickly, in later missions we'll learn how to quantify the tradeoff we make between accuracy and speed to determine the optimal number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we'll be randomizing the groups each value belongs to, we created a list named all_values that contains just the weight loss values.\n",

If this value is high, it means that the difference in the amount of weight both groups lost could have easily happened randomly and the weight loss pills probably didn't play a role.

    "- Research design is incredibly important and can bias your results. For example, if the participants in group A realized they were given placebo sugar pills, they may modify their behavior and affect the outcome.\n",
    "- The p value threshold you set can also affect the conclusion you reach.\n",
    "    - If you set **too high of a p value** threshold, you may accept the alternative hypothesis incorrectly and reject the null hypothesis. This is known as a **type I error**.\n",
    "    - If you set **too low of a p** value threshold, you may reject the alternative hypothesis incorrectly in favor of accepting the null hypothesis. This is known as a **type II error**."
