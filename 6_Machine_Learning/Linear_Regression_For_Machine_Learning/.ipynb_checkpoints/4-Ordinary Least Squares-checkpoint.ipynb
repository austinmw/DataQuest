    "## 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last mission, we explored an iterative technique for model fitting named gradient descent. The gradient descent algorithm requires multiple iterations to converge on the optimal parameter values and the number of iterations is highly dependent on the initial parameter values and the learning rate we select.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll explore a technique called **ordinary least squares estimation** or OLS estimation for short. Unlike gradient descent, OLS estimation provides a clear formula to directly calculate the optimal parameter values that minimizes the cost function. To understand OLS estimation, we need to first frame our linear regression problem in the matrix form. We've mostly worked with the following form of the linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y} = a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "While this form represents the relationship between the features ($x_1$ to $x_n$) and the target column ($y$) well when there are just a few parameter values, it doesn't scale well to when we have hundreds of parameters. If you recall from the [Linear Algebra for Machine Learning course](https://www.dataquest.io/course/linear-algebra-for-machine-learning), we explored how matrix notation lets us better represent and reason about a linear system with many variables. With that in mind, here's what the matrix form of our linear regression model looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Xa  =  \\hat{y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $X$ is a matrix representing the columns from the training set our model uses, $a$ is a vector representing the parameter values, and $y$ is the vector of predictions. Here's a diagram with some sample values for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "**broken image link, fix later**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've gained an understanding for the matrix representation of the linear regression model, let's take a peek at the OLS estimation formula that results in the optimal vector $A$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a = (X^TX)^{-1} X^Ty$\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: $(X^TX)^{-1} X^T$ is called the [Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore–Penrose_pseudoinverse) matrix of X. This formulation highlights the point that estimation can be carried out if, and only if, there is no perfect [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) between the explanatory variables (which would cause the matrix $(X^TX)$ to have no inverse).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by computing OLS estimation to find the best parameters for a model using the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    features = ['Wood Deck SF', 'Fireplaces', 'Full Bath', '1st Flr SF', 'Garage Area',\n",
    "           'Gr Liv Area', 'Overall Qual']\n",
    "           \n",
    "In the following screens, we'll dive into the mathematical derivation of the OLS estimation technique. It's important to note that you'll most likely never implement this technique in a data science role and will instead use an existing, efficient implementation (scikit-learn uses OLS under the hood when you call `fit()` on a [LinearRegression instance](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "- Select just the features in features from the training set and assign to X.\n",
    "- Select the SalePrice column from the training set and assign to y.\n",
    "- Use the OLS estimation formula to return the optimal parameter values.         "

    "Unlike gradient descent, OLS estimation provides what is known as a **closed form solution** to the problem of finding the optimal parameter values. A closed form solution is one where a solution can be computed arithmetically with a predictable amount of mathematical operations. Gradient descent, on the other hand, is an algorithmic approach that can require a different number of iteration (and therefore a different number of mathematical operations) based on the initial parameter values, the learning rate, etc. While the approach is different, both techniques share the high level objective of minimizing the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can dive into how the cost function is represented in the matrix form, let's understand how the error is represented. Because the error is the difference between the predictions made using the model $\\hat y$ and the actual labels $y$, it's represented as a vector.
