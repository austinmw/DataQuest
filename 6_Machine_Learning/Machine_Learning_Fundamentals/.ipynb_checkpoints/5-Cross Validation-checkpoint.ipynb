    "In an earlier mission, we learned about train/test validation, a simple technique for testing a machine learning model's accuracy on new data that the model wasn't trained on. In this mission, we'll focus on more robust techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we'll focus on the **holdout validation** technique, which involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- splitting the full dataset into 2 partitions:\n",
    "    - a training set\n",
    "    - a test set\n",
    "- training the model on the training set,\n",
    "- using the trained model to predict labels on the test set,\n",
    "- computing an error metric to understand the model's effectiveness,\n",
    "- switch the training and test sets and repeat,\n",
    "- average the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In holdout validation, we usually use a 50/50 split instead of the 75/25 split from train/test validation. This way, we remove number of observations as a potential source of variation in our model performance.\n",

    "If we average the two RMSE values from the last step, we get an RMSE value of approximately **128.96**. Holdout validation is actually a specific example of a larger class of validation techniques called **k-fold cross-validation**. While holdout validation is better than train/test validation because the model isn't repeatedly biased towards a specific subset of the data, both models that are trained only use half the available data. K-fold cross validation, on the other hand, takes advantage of a larger proportion of the data during training while still rotating through different subsets of the data to avoid the issues of train/test validation.\n",

    "- using the trained model to predict labels on the test fold,\n",
    "- computing the test fold's error metric,\n",
    "- repeating all of the above steps k-1 times, until each partition has been used as the test set for an iteration,\n",
    "- calculating the mean of the k error values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holdout validation is essentially a version of k-fold cross validation when k is equal to 2. Generally, 5 or 10 folds is used for k-fold cross-validation. Here's a diagram describing each iteration of 5-fold cross validation:\n",

This large amount of variability between the RMSE values means that we're either using a poor model or a poor evaluation criteria (or a bit of both!). By implementing your own k-fold cross-validation function, you hopefully acquired a good understanding of the inner workings of the technique. The function we wrote, however, has many limitations. If we want to now change the number of folds we want to use, we need to make the function more general so it can also handle randomizing the ordering of the rows in the dataframe and splitting into folds.\n",

To build a better k-nearest neighbors model, we can change the features it uses or tweak the number of neighbors (a hyperparameter). To accurately understand a model's performance, we can perform k-fold cross validation and select the proper number of folds. We've learned how scikit-learn makes it easy for us to quickly experiment with these different knobs when it comes to building a better model.

Through lots of trial and error, data scientists have converged on 10 as the standard k value.\n",

You'll notice that the standard deviation of the RMSE increases from approximately 1.1 to 37.3 as we increase the number the folds."

For example, assuming that only one feature, like a car's weight, relates to a car's fuel efficiency will lead you to fit a simple, univariate regression model that will result in high bias. The error rate will be high since a car's fuel efficiency is affected by many other factors besides just its weight.\n",

If we were given a dataset with 1000 features on each car and used every single feature to train an incredibly complicated multivariate regression model, we will have low bias but high variance. In an ideal world, we want low bias and low variance but in reality, there's always a tradeoff.\n",
