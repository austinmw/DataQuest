    "\n",
    "In the last mission, we explored how to use a simple k-nearest neighbors machine learning model that used just one feature, or attribute, of the listing to predict the rent price. We first relied on the accommodates column, which describes the number of people a living space can comfortably accommodate. Then, we switched to the bathrooms column and observed an improvement in accuracy. While these were good features to become familiar with the basics of machine learning, it's clear that using just a single feature to compare listings doesn't reflect the reality of the market. An apartment that can accommodate 4 guests in a popular part of Washington D.C. will rent for much higher than one that can accommodate 4 guests in a crime ridden area.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 ways we can tweak the model to try to improve the accuracy (decrease the RMSE during validation):\n",
    "\n",
    "- increase the number of attributes the model uses to calculate similarity when ranking the closest neighbors\n",
    "- increase k, the number of nearby neighbors the model uses when computing the prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll focus on increasing the number of attributes the model uses. When selecting more attributes to use in the model, we need to watch out for columns that don't work well with the distance equation. This includes columns containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- non-numerical values (e.g. city or state)\n",
    "    - Euclidean distance equation expects numerical values\n",
    "- missing values\n",
    "    - distance equation expects a value for each observation and attribute\n",
    "- non-ordinal values (e.g. latitude or longitude)\n",
    "    - ranking by Euclidean distance doesn't make sense if all attributes aren't ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code screen, we've read the dc_airbnb.csv dataset from the last mission into pandas and brought over the data cleaning changes we made. Let's first look at the first row's values to identify any columns containing non-numerical or non-ordinal values. In the next screen, we'll drop those columns and then look for missing values in each of the remaining columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "- Use the DataFrame.info() method to return the number of non-null values in each column."

    "\n",
    "So far, we've been writing functions from scratch to train the k-nearest neighbor models. While this is helpful deliberate practice to understand how the mechanics work, you can be more productive and iterate quicker by using a library that handles most of the implementation. In this screen, we'll learn about the [scikit-learn library](http://scikit-learn.org/), which is the most popular machine learning in Python. Scikit-learn contains functions for all of the major machine learning algorithms and a simple, unified workflow. Both of these properties allow data scientists to be incredibly productive when training and testing different models on a new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn workflow consists of 4 main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- instantiate the specific machine learning model you want to use\n",
    "- fit the model to the training data\n",
    "- use the model to make predictions\n",
    "- evaluate the accuracy of the predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the first 3 steps in this screen and the next screen. Each model in scikit-learn is implemented as a [separate class](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/classes.html) and the first step is to identify the class we want to create an instance of. In our case, we want to use the [KNeighborsRegressor class](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any model that helps us predict numerical values, like listing price in our case, is known as a **regression** model. The other main class of machine learning models is called **classification**, where we're trying to predict a label from a fixed set of labels (e.g. blood type or gender). The word **regressor** from the class name `KNeighborsRegressor` refers to the regression model class that we just discussed.\n",

We explored how using more features doesn't always improve the accuracy of a k-nearest neighbors model. In the next mission, we'll explore another knob for tuning k-nearest neighbor models -- the k value."
