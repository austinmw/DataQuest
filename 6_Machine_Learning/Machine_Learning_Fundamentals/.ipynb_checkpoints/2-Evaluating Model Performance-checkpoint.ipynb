    "\n",
    "We now have a function that can predict the price for any living space we want to list as long as we know the number of people it can accommodate. The function we wrote represents a **machine learning model**, which means that it outputs a prediction based on the input to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to test the quality of your model is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- split the dataset into 2 partitions:\n",
    "    - the training set: contains the majority of the rows (75%)\n",
    "    - the test set: contains the remaining minority of the rows (25%)\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the rows in the training set to predict the price value for the rows in the test set\n",
    "    - add new column named predicted_price to the test set\n",
    "- compare the predicted_price values with the actual price values in the test set to see how accurate the predicted values were.\n",
    "\n",
    "This validation process, where we use the training set to make predictions and the test set to predict values for, is known as **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "train/test validation**. Whenever you're performing machine learning, you want to perform validation of some kind to ensure that your machine learning model can make good predictions on new data. While train/test validation isn't perfect, we'll use it to understand the validation process, to select an error metric, and then we'll dive into a more robust validation process later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's modify the predict_price function to use only the rows in the training set, instead of the full dataset, to find the nearest neighbors, average the price values for those rows, and return the predicted price value. Then, we'll use this function to predict the price for just the rows in the test set. Once we have the predicted price values, we can compare with the true price values and start to understand the model's effectiveness in the next screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we've gone ahead and assigned the first 75% of the rows in dc_listings to train_df and the last 25% of the rows to test_df. Here's a diagram explaining the split:\n",

As the name suggests, an error metric quantifies how inaccurate our predictions were from the actual values. In our case, the error metric tells us how off our predicted price values were from the actual price values for the living spaces in the test dataset.\n",

This is because the units of the MSE metric are squared (in this case, dollars squared).

The only difference between the 2 sets of errors is the extreme 1000 value in errors_two instead of 10. When we're working with larger data sets, we can't inspect each value to understand if there's one or some outliers or if all of the errors are systematically higher. **Looking at the ratio of MAE to RMSE can help us understand if there are large but infrequent errors.** You can read more about comparing MAE and RMSE in [this wonderful post](https://medium.com/human-in-a-machine-world/mae-and-rmse-which-metric-is-better-e60ac3bde13d#.lyc8od1ix).\n",
