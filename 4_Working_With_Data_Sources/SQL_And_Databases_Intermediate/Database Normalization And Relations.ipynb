    "\n",
    "A **one-to-many** relation exists whenever many rows in one table need to relate to one row in the other table. The relation between ceremonies and nominations is a one-to-many relation since many rows in the nominations table can be linked to an individual row in the ceremonies table. A row in the ceremonies table contains no reference to the nominations table. However, many rows in the nominations table contain a reference to the ceremonies table using the ceremony_id foreign key.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/pic4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to remember in a one-to-many relation is that the reference is one-sided. The nominations table contains a foreign key reference to the id column in ceremonies but the ceremonies table contains no references to values in the nominations table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other examples of one-to-many relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a car insurance policy can have multiple people on it, but each person can only belong to one policy.\n",
    "- a mother can have many children, but each child can only have one birth mother.\n",

    "## 4: Querying A Normalized Database\n",

    "As with many things in software development, there is a tradeoff to database normalization. We need to write longer queries sometimes and use joins more often to grab information from multiple tables. Many companies have databases with hundreds or thousands of tables with many relations in between, so this can get complicated quickly! As you become more familiar with querying normalized databases, you'll be able to overcome the added complexity much more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a query that involves 2 tables that are in a one-to-many relation, you need to **join on the foreign key column that the \"many\" side uses to reference the \"one\" side**. When using the WHERE statement to express filtering criteria, we can use columns from both tables. For example, to return all of the movies that won an award in 2010, we'd need to write the following query:\n",

    "\n",
    "While normalization helps reduce data redundancy and allows us to decouple related columns into separate tables, too much normalization can do more harm than good. A highly normalized database means that even some basic queries can involve joining multiple tables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have wondered why we didn't try to separate out the actors (nominee column) and the movie names (movie column) in the nominations table. We could have replaced these columns with foreign key references to the actors and movies tables instead. This is because we probably wouldn't have realized the gains of normalization by replacing the actual values with foreign key references.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think that we'll almost always be accessing the movies and actors names when we're querying the nominations table, then forcing the user to do multiple joins to get the relevant information is quite cumbersome. In addition, we know that once an awards ceremony has finished, the movies and nominees are not going to change. This means that another benefit of normalization, easy updating and editing of related values, probably won't be realized.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we represented the year and host columns in a separate table from the nominations table, we made the assumption that we don't always need to access both columns every single time when querying the nominations table. We preferred having less data redundancy and writing a join when we needed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's important to remember that the schema isn't set in stone. In many cases, it's best to start out with a denormalized representation of your data with one, or a few, giant tables. As your data grows and your use cases change, you can rethink your schema and restructure your data accordingly. When structuring your data and writing a schema, it's important to remember the tradeoffs that come with normalization."
