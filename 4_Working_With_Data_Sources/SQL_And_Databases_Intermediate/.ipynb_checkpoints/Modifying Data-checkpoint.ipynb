    "## 1: Modifying Data In Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many times when we don't just want to query data from SQL tables, and instead we want to modify the existing data or add new data. Modifying data in SQL tables is possible through 3 statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>INSERT</mark> -- adds new data.\n",
    "- <mark>UPDATE</mark> -- changes the values of some columns in existing data.\n",
    "- <mark>DELETE</mark> -- removes existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll cover these 3 statements. As we do so, we'll be working with factbook.db, a SQLite database that contains information about each country in the world. We'll be working with a table in the file called facts. Each row in facts represents a single country, and contains several columns, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- name -- the name of the country.\n",
    "- area -- the total land and sea area of the country.\n",
    "- population -- the population of the country.\n",

    "## 2: Working With Dates In SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Dates are an extremely important part of querying and analyzing data. Some common use cases are segmenting records by date, figuring out how many events occurred on each date, and finding all the dates on which a particular event occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how common it is to use dates when querying data, SQL has built-in support for handling dates. It makes it easy to query based on date and time ranges. We can query a date range from the facts table using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``SELECT * FROM facts WHERE created_at < \"2015-11-01\" AND created_at > \"2015-10-30\";``\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what's happening in this query:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL is comparing the created_at column in facts to 2015-11-01, and selecting any rows where created_at is less.\n",
    "- SQL is comparing the created_at column in facts to 2015-10-30, and selecting any rows where created_at is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recognize that this looks exactly like some of the WHERE statements you used in previous missions. The only caveat is to put the date you want to compare in quotes so SQL parses the date properly. Dates have a natural ordering, and SQL automatically uses this ordering. For example, 2015-11-01 is greater than 2015-10-30, because it comes afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also query based on times using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``SELECT [columnA, columnB, ...]\n",
    "FROM tableName\n",
    "WHERE dateColumn < \"date1\"\n",
    "AND dateColumn > \"date2\";``\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a concrete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``SELECT * FROM facts \n",
    "WHERE created_at < \"2015-11-01 14:00\"\n",
    "AND created_at > \"2015-10-30 12:00\";``\n",
    "\n",
    "The above SQL query selects any rows in facts that were created between 12pm on October 30th, 2015, and 2pm on November 1st, 2015. If you're not familiar with the time notation, it's military time, a 24-hour clock which starts at 0:00 (midnight), and ends at 24:00. 9:00 military time is 9am, and 17:00 military time is 5pm. The primary advantage of military time is that we don't need to specify am or pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "- Select any rows from facts where updated_at is greater than October 30th, 2015 at 4pm, and updated_at is less than November 2nd, 2015 at 3pm."

    "## 3: Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables can have data types, such as string, float, or integer. Whereas these data types don't have to be specified upfront in Python, each column in a SQL table has to have a data type specified when the table is created. This helps SQL store and search the data efficiently. Every SQL database engine has slightly different names for data types. Some of the common data types for SQLite are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- INTEGER -- similar to the integer type in Python.\n",
    "- REAL -- similar to the float type in Python.\n",
    "- FLOAT -- similar to the float type in Python.\n",
    "- TEXT -- similar to the string type in Python.\n",
    "- VARCHAR(255) -- similar to the string type in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why SQLite has so many names for similar data types is to provide compatibility with other databases, some of which will only allow one or the other (REAL or FLOAT, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the data types of each column in a table, you can use the PRAGMA statement:\n",
    "\n",
