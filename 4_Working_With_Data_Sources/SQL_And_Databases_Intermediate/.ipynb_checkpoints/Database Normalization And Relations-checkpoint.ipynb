    "In this mission, we'll work with data on Academy Award nominations from 2001 to 2010 for just the lead and supporting acting roles. The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry. There are many different awards categories and the members of the academy vote every year to decide which artist or film should get the award. The full dataset, containing data on all award categories from years 1927 to 2010, can be found [here](https://www.aggdata.com/awards/oscar).

    "## 3: Types Of Relations\n",

    "\n",
    "A **one-to-many** relation exists whenever many rows in one table need to relate to one row in the other table. The relation between ceremonies and nominations is a one-to-many relation since many rows in the nominations table can be linked to an individual row in the ceremonies table. A row in the ceremonies table contains no reference to the nominations table. However, many rows in the nominations table contain a reference to the ceremonies table using the ceremony_id foreign key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram that demonstrates how multiple rows in the nominations table, that share the same ceremony_id of 10, relate to the row in the ceremonies table whose id is 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/pic4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to remember in a one-to-many relation is that the reference is one-sided. The nominations table contains a foreign key reference to the id column in ceremonies but the ceremonies table contains no references to values in the nominations table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other examples of one-to-many relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a car insurance policy can have multiple people on it, but each person can only belong to one policy.\n",
    "- a mother can have many children, but each child can only have one birth mother.\n",

    "## 4: Querying A Normalized Database\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many things in software development, there is a tradeoff to database normalization. We need to write longer queries sometimes and use joins more often to grab information from multiple tables. Many companies have databases with hundreds or thousands of tables with many relations in between, so this can get complicated quickly! As you become more familiar with querying normalized databases, you'll be able to overcome the added complexity much more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a query that involves 2 tables that are in a one-to-many relation, you need to **join on the foreign key column that the \"many\" side uses to reference the \"one\" side**. When using the WHERE statement to express filtering criteria, we can use columns from both tables. For example, to return all of the movies that won an award in 2010, we'd need to write the following query:\n",

    "\n",
    "``SELECT movie FROM nominations \n",
    "INNER JOIN ceremonies\n",

    "\n",
    "When joining 2 tables, you can be more explicit about which columns you want returned from which tables using dot notation -- e.g. nominations.movie. In the following query, we modified the earlier query to select the year and host columns from ceremonies and the movie and nominee columns from nominations:\n",

We need a way to represent the relation between actors and movies. Our first instinct might be to use a movies table, an actors table, and specify a one-to-many relationship between them. The movies table could contain an actor_id field that acts as a foreign key reference to the id column from the actors table.\n",
