    "## 1: Introduction To The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in the **SQL and Databases: Intermediate course**, we explored how to modify existing data in a table and create our own schemas. In the [Database Normalization and Relations mission](https://www.dataquest.io/mission/181/database-normalization-and-relations), we then learned about the benefits of normalization and how to query an existing database on Academy Award nominations. In the previous guided project, we walked through how to clean and prepare the original CSV dataset on Academy Award nominations and export the data into a SQLite database as a single, denormalized table. In this guided project, we will walk through how to normalize our single table into multiple tables and how to create relations between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to either our guided projects or Jupyter notebook in general, you can learn more [here](https://www.dataquest.io/mission/162/guided-project-using-jupyter-notebook). You can find the solutions to this guided project [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission216Solutions.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick refresher, the Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry. There are many different awards categories and the members of the academy vote every year to decide which artist or film should get the award. Each row in our data represents a nomination for an award. Recall that our database file, <mark>nominations.db</mark>, contains just the `nominations` table. This table has the following schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Year - the year of the awards ceremony, integer type.\n",
    "- Category - the category of award the nominee was nominated for, text type.\n",
    "- Nominee - the person nominated for the award, text type.\n",
    "- Movie - the movie the nominee participated in, text type.\n",
    "- Character - the name of the character the nominee played, text type.\n",
    "- Won - if this nominee won the award, integer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now set up our enviroment and spend some time getting familiar with the data before we start normalizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's first get everything you need setup.\n",
    "    - Import sqlite3 into the environment.\n",
    "    - Connect to nominations.db and assign the Connection instance to conn.\n",
    "- Let's now write and run some queries to explore the data.\n",
    "    - Return the schema using pragma table_info() and assign to schema.\n",
    "    - Return the first 10 rows using the SELECT and LIMIT statements and assign to first_ten.\n",
    "    - Since both schema and first_ten are lists, use a for loop to iterate over each element and print each element. This makes our output easier to understand."

    "\n",
    "Let's now add information on the host for each awards ceremony. Instead of adding a Host column to the nominations table and having lots of redundant data, we'll create a separate table called ceremonies which contains data specific to the ceremony itself.\n",

In this screen, we'll focus on creating the ceremonies table and inserting the data we need and in the next guided step, we'll focus on setting up the one-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",

    "- id - unique identifier for each row, integer type.\n",
    "- Year - the year of the awards ceremony, integer type.\n",
    "- Host - the host of the awards ceremony, text type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can create and insert into the ceremonies table, we need to look up the host for each ceremony from 2000 to 2010. While we could represent each row as a tuple and write a SQL query with an INSERT statement to add each row to the ceremonies table, this is incredibly cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python sqlite3 library comes with an `executemany` method that let's us easily mass insert records into a table.

    "For example, since the ceremonies table only contains the id values 1 to 10, inserting a row into nominations while specifying that the ceremony_id value be 11 will work and no error will be returned. This is problematic because if we try to actually join that row with the ceremonies table, the results set will be empty since the id value 11 doesn't map to any row in the ceremonies table. To prevent us from inserting rows with nonexisting foreign key values, we need to turn on foreign key constraints by running the following query:\n",
