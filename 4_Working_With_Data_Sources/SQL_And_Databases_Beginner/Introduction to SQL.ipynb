    "## 1: Introduction To Databases And SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous missions, we worked with data sets stored in a single file, which was usually a CSV file. While CSV files are easy to interface with, they have a lot of limitations. It's difficult to load large CSV files into a computer's memory, which is where tools like pandas work with data. CSV files also fall short when it comes to providing security for production applications (imagine if companies like Google or Facebook used CSV files to store and access data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, CSV files are optimized for static representation. If your data changes quickly, which is true for most technology companies, then you'll need to adopt a different method.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a repository designed for storing, querying, and processing data. Databases store the data we want, and expose an interface for interacting with it. Most technology companies use databases to **structure** the data they generate and **query** specific subsets of it later on in order to answer questions or make updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database systems come with administrative software for configuring settings, controlling security and access, and generating reports. They also include a language for interfacing with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll be focusing on a language called **SQL**, or Structured Query Language. We use SQL to query, update, and modify the data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is the most common language for working with databases, and an important tool in any data professional's toolkit. While SQL is a language, it's quite different from languages like Python or R. Its creators built it specifically for querying and interacting with databases, so it won't have much of the functionality you can expect in traditional programming languages. Because SQL is a [declarative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming), the user focuses on expressing what he or she wants, and the computer focuses on figuring out how to perform the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into SQL syntax, we'll introduce a few database concepts so you're aware of how databases represent data, and why SQL makes it easy to work with that data."

    "A database is a collection of **tables**. Each table is made up of **rows** of data, and each row has values for the same set of **columns**. A table is very similar to a dataframe in pandas, or the structure of a CSV file. These all have rows of values with a consistent set of columns.\n",

    "## 3: Querying Databases With SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a SQL query is the primary way to interact with a database. A SQL query has to adhere to a defined structure and vocabulary that we use to specify what we want the database to do. The SQL language has a set of general statements that we combine with specific logic to express the intent of our query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most basic statement in SQL is a <font color='red'>SELECT</font> statement. To specify that we want to return 10 specific columns for all of the rows in a certain table, we use the `SELECT` keyword, along with the names of the 10 columns. We use a `SELECT` statement whenever we want to return specific data from the database without editing or modifying it.\n",

Now let's see what an actual SQL query looks like. The following query selects the `Rank` and `Major` columns from the table `recent_grads`, which represents the information from `recent-grads.csv` as a table in the database:\n",
