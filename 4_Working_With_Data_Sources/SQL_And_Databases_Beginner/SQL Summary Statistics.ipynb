    "## 2: Counting The Number Of Rows In SQL\n",
    "Counting the number of records in a table is a common operation, and it feels like it should be more efficient than the code we just wrote on the last screen. Thankfully, SQL has a COUNT aggregation function that allows us to count the number of records in a table. We call it an aggregation function because it works across many rows to calculate an aggregate value. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM facts;`` \n",
    "\n",
    "The query above will count the number of rows in the facts table of factbook.db. If we want to count the number of non-null values in a single column instead, we can use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "``SELECT COUNT(area_water) \n",
    "FROM facts;``\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this query will only count the total number of non-null values in the area_water column. That means it can return a different total than COUNT(*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the queries above will return a list with a single tuple when we execute it in Python. The result will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``[(243,)]``\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the integer count from the result, we'll need to extract the first element in the first tuple of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This style saves typing, and it's also much faster for larger data sets. That's because we can do the counting inside the database, rather than having to pull all of the data into the Python environment first. In general, doing operations within a SQL database engine will be faster than doing the equivalent operations after pulling the data into a programming environment. This is because SQL database engines are optimized specifically for querying.\n",

    "- Use the COUNT aggregation function to count the number of non-null values in the birth_rate column of the facts table.\n",

    "Sometimes we'll want to perform some arithmetic on the columns in a SQL table. We might want to make the counts in the population column easier to understand by expressing them in terms of millions, for example. Instead of a number like 9766442, we'd want to display 9.766442. We could do this in Python, but it would be cumbersome to pull all of the data into the Python environment and then manipulate it. Fortunately, we can perform the math inside the SQL database engine instead. Here's an example:\n",

It's often advantageous to do these computations in the SQL database instead of a Python environment because it's faster to code and execute. In the next mission, we'll cover how to calculate more advanced statistics in SQL with the GROUP BY statement."
