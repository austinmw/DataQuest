    "## 1: Introduction\n",
    "We looked at a basic API in the last mission. That API didn't require authentication, but most do. Imagine that you're using the reddit API to pull a list of your private messages. It would be a huge privacy breach for reddit to give that information to anyone, so requiring authentication makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs also use authentication to perform *rate limiting*. Developers typically use APIs to build interesting applications or services. In order to ensure that it remains available and responsive for all users, an API will prevent you from making too many requests in too short a time. We call this restriction rate limiting. It ensures that one user can't overload the API server by making too many requests too fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll explore the GitHub API and use it to pull some interesting data on repositories and users. GitHub is a site for hosting code. If you haven't looked at it, you should - it's a great place to share a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub has user accounts [(example)](https://github.com/torvalds), repositories that contain code [(example)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), and organizations that companies can create [(example)](https://github.com/dataquestio).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the [documentation for the GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), and specifically the [authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) section."

    "## 2: API Authentication\n",
    "To authenticate with the GitHub API, we'll need to use an access token. An access token is a credential we can [generate on GitHub's website](https://github.com/settings/tokens). The token is a string that the API can read and associate with your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a token is preferable to a username and password for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you'll be accessing an API from a script. If you put your username and password in the script and someone manages to get their hands on it, they can take over your account. In contrast, you can revoke an access token to cancel an unauthorized person's access if there's a security breach.\n",
    "Access tokens can have scopes and specific permissions. For instance, you can make a token that has permission to write to your GitHub repositories and make new ones. Or, you can make a token that can only read from your repositories. Using read-access-only tokens in potentially insecure or shared scripts gives you more control over security.\n",
    "You'll need to pass your token to the GitHub API through an Authorization header. Just like the server sends headers in response to our request, we can send the server headers when we make a request. Headers contain metadata about the request. We can use Python's `requests` library to make a dictionary of headers, and then pass it into our request.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to include the word `token` in the Authorization header, followed by our access token. Here's an example of an Authorization header:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`{\"Authorization\": \"token 1f36137fbbe1602f779300dad26e4c1b7fbab631\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our access token is `1f36137fbbe1602f779300dad26e4c1b7fbab631`. GitHub generated this token and associated it with the account of `Vik Paruchuri`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should **never** share your token with anyone you don't want to have access to your account. We've revoked the token you'll be using throughout this mission, so it isn't valid anymore. Consider a token somewhat equivalent to a password, and store it securely."

    "## 5: Pagination\n",
    "Sometimes, a request can return a lot of objects. This might happen when you're doing something like listing out all of a user's repositories, for example. Returning too much data will take a long time and slow the server down. For example, if a user has 1,000+ repositories, requesting all of them might take 10+ seconds. This isn't a great user experience, so it's typical for API providers to implement **pagination**. This means that the API provider will only return a certain number of records per page. You can specify the page number that you want to access. To access all of the pages, you'll need to write a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the repositories a user has starred (marked as interesting), we can use the following API endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://api.github.com/users/VikParuchuri/starred\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add two pagination query parameters to it - `page`, and `per_page`. `page` is the page we want to access, and `per_page` is the number of records we want to see on each page. Typically, API providers enforce a cap on how high `per_page` can be, because setting it to an extremely high value defeats the purpose of pagination.\n",
